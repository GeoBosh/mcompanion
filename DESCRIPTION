Description:
    Provides a class for multi-companion matrices with methods for
    arithmetic and factorization.  A method for generation of
    multi-companion matrices with prespecified spectral properties is
    provided, as well as some utilities for periodically correlated and
    multivariate time series models. See Boshnakov (2002)
