Description:
    Provides a class for multi-companion matrices with methods for
    arithmetic and factorization.  A method for generation of
    multi-companion matrices with prespecified spectral properties is
    provided, as well as some utilities for periodically correlated and
    multivariate time series models. See Boshnakov (2002)
    <doi:10.1016/S0024-3795(01)00475-X> and Boshnakov & Iqelan (2009)
